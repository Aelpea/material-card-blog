# Material Card blog

Built with Jekyll, this blog theme uses Google's [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io) framework. Its primary aim is to be fast, responsive and light. With all external resources minified and gzipped, the homepage weighs under 500KB and loads near instantly while maintaining a beautiful design. Subsequent page loads will be faster

A live demo is available [here](https://zogthealien.tk/material-card-blog/).

This theme is a stripped down fork of my personal blog, available [here](https://zogthealien.tk/blog/).
